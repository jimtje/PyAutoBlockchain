# PyAutoBlockchain (PAB)

Pool Auto Compounder for the Polygon (MATIC) network.

Currently, the only available strategy was tested in a specific pool in Polyzap, but you should be able to easily extend it to
other pools, farms, tokens and blockchain networks (see [Configuration](#configuration)).


## DISCLAIMER

This is a side-project, for personal use and learning purposes, and it may fall unmainteined in the future.

I cannot assure completely correct handling of your assets.

I'm not assosiated with any of the farms/pools/blockchains mentioned in the project or any other crypto project.

Read the code, use at your own risk and always DYOR.


## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/manuelpepe/PolyAutoCompounder
$ cd PyAutoBlockchain
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -e .
```


## Usage

```bash
(venv) $ polycompound create-keyfile [-o keyfile]  # Create keyfile
(venv) $ polycompound edit-config  # Edit config file
(venv) $ polycompound list-strategies -v  # List available strategies and parameters
(venv) $ polycompound run  # Run compounding
```

## Configuration

### Configure wallet and RPC 

Create project config and keyfile:

```bash
(venv) $ polycompound edit-config
(venv) $ polycompound create-keyfile
```

You can get register at [MaticVigil](https://rpc.maticvigil.com/) for a free RPC account.

### Adding extra contracts

To use contracts in the strategies you first need to add the abi file to `resources/abis` and 
modify the `resources/contracts.json` file to load it.

For example, given the contract for `MYTOKEN` at `0x12345` create the abifile at `resources/abis/mytoken.abi` and add
to `resources/contracts.json` the following:

```json
{
    "MYTOKEN": {
        "address": "0x12345",
        "abifile": "mytoken.abi"
    }
}
```

### Adding extra strategies

You can add strategies to execute at `resources/strategies.json`.
For example, the following example defines 1 estrategy to execute, using the strategy `PZAPPoolCompoundStrategy` 
and the contracts `PZAP`, `WBTC`, `PAIR`, `MASTERCHEF` and `ROUTER`.

```json
[
    {
        "strategy": "PZAPPoolCompoundStrategy",
        "name": "PZAP-WBTC",
        "repeat_every": {
            "days": 1
        },
        "params": {
            "swap_path": ["PZAP", "WBTC"],
            "pair": "PAIR",
            "masterchef": "MASTERCHEF",
            "router": "ROUTER",
            "pool_id": 11
        }
    }
]
```

Strategies are dictionaries with:

* `strategy`: Class name of strategy (must be subclass of `pab.strategy.CompoundStrategy`, see `polycompound list-strategies`)
* `name`: Name, just for logging.
* `params`: Dictionary with strategy parameters. (see `polycompound list-strategies -v`)
* `repeat_every`: _Optional_. Dictionary with periodicity of the process, same arguments as `datetime.timedelta`.

Run `polycompound list-strategies -v` to see available strategies and parameters.

### Email alerts

You can setup email alerts for when something goes wrong.
Add the following to your `resources/config.json`:

```json
{
    "emails": {
        "enabled": true,
        "host": "smtp.host.com",
        "port": 465,
        "address": "email@host.com",
        "password": "password",
        "recipient": "me@host.com"
    }   
}
```
